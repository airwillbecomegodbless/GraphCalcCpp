# **GraphCalcCpp**
### GraphCalcCpp is a lightweight 2D graphing calculator written in C++ with rendering powered by SDL and compiled to the web using Emscripten. 
### It provides a simple and fast way to visualize functions, with a custom math interpreter and smooth zoom controls.

## **Features**
* Plot one function at a time
* Supprots linear and general function formats:
  * y = x
  * y = 2*x
  * y = (2)(x)
* Custom-built math interpreter
* Smooth zooming in/out
* Renders directly in the browser through WebAssembly
* Lightweight and fast

## **Current Limitations / Planned Feautures**
* Cannot parse expression-style inputs like x^2
* Does not understand implicit multiplication like 2x (must use 2*x or (2)(x) instead)
* Only one function can be graphed at a time
